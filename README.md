<h1 align="center">JokeGenerator-JavaScript</h1>

# Overview:

A joke generator was made by following along to an Udemy video. It can generate a joke whenever the user clicks on the button.
It contains a async-await function and a simple fetch API. I added a SpeechSynthesisUtterance that will read the joke when
the user clicks on the audio button.
