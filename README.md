<h1 align="center">JokeGenerator-JavaScript</h1>

# Overview:

A joke generator was made by following along to an Udemy and YouTube videos. It can generate a joke whenever the user clicks
on the button. It contains a async-await function and a simple fetch API. I added some few other function to the project. 
There is a SpeechSynthesisUtterance that will read the joke when clicking on the audio button. It can copy the joke by clicking on the clipboards 
image and change to light/dark mode by moving the toggle.
