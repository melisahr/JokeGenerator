<h1 align="center">JokeGenerator</h1>

# Overview:

This joke generator was made by following along to an Udemy and YouTube videos. It can generate a joke whenever the user clicks
on the button. It contains a async-await function and a simple fetch API. I added some few other functions to the project. 
I added a SpeechSynthesisUtterance to read the joke when clicking on the audio button. It can copy the joke by clicking on the 
clipboards icon and change to light/dark mode by moving the toggle. 

Language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
